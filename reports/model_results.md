# Model Results and Business Implications

## 1. Model Performance Metrics

### Logistic Regression Model
- Accuracy: 59.2%
- Precision:
  * No Accident (0): 46%
  * Accident (1): 71%
- Recall: 59% (both classes)
- F1-score:
  * No Accident (0): 51%
  * Accident (1): 65%

### Random Forest Model
- Accuracy: 57.2%
- Precision:
  * No Accident (0): 41%
  * Accident (1): 65%
- Recall:
  * No Accident (0): 35%
  * Accident (1): 70%
- F1-score:
  * No Accident (0): 38%
  * Accident (1): 67%

Model Comparison:
- Logistic Regression performs slightly better overall
- Both models show stronger performance in predicting accidents
- Random Forest shows higher recall for accidents but lower precision for non-accidents

## 2. Key Features and Interpretation
Based on feature importance analysis:

- **Experience Age**:
  - Combines age and experience effects
  - Critical factor in risk assessment

- **Age**:
  - Independent age effect
  - Important for risk stratification

- **Annual Mileage**:
  - Direct exposure metric
  - Key factor for usage-based pricing

- **Driving Experience**:
  - Independent of age effects
  - Important for risk assessment

## 3. Recommendations for Risk Mitigation

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Consider using Logistic Regression for its slightly better performance
   - Potentially ensemble both models for robust predictions
   - Focus on improving non-accident prediction accuracy

2. **Risk Assessment Priorities**:
   - Focus on experience and age factors
   - Implement usage-based monitoring
   - Consider driver history carefully

3. **Business Applications**:
   - Higher confidence in accident predictions (65-70% accuracy)
   - More conservative approach needed for non-accident predictions
   - Use probability thresholds for decision-making

## 4. Model Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Class Imbalance**:
   - Original distribution: 2629 accidents vs 1343 non-accidents
   - SMOTE balancing applied: 2126 vs 2126
   - Consider other balancing techniques

2. **Performance Gaps**:
   - Room for improvement in non-accident predictions
   - Consider collecting additional relevant features
   - Explore more sophisticated modeling techniques

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Collect more granular driving behavior data
   - Implement real-time risk assessment
   - Consider more advanced feature engineering
